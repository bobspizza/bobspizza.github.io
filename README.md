The glyphs or whatever you want to call them will appear if you comment out the content of the 'known' array in the JavaScript file. 

I did this to check the work of someone who posted the result of their decoding of the glyphs in the album artwork on the discogs page and to see where the uncertainty was.

The big yellow glyphs are "covert3". One artist was known. The other artist names were unknown, until the artwork was decoded.
