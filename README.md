for Touched Music compilation Covert 3

The "Covert" comps feature anonymous artists, but they put the artists names encoded in the artwork for Covert 3. One poster on the discogs page posted the results from their decoding. The poster indicated some uncertainty, so I decided to check their work using HTML and JS, which made it easy to try different values for the symbols.

The big yellow symbols are "covert3". One artist was known, brainwaltzera. The other artist names were unknown, until the artwork was decoded.

The symbols will appear if you comment out the content of the 'known' array in the JavaScript file in your local clone. 

Red squares are obscured but definitely there. Blue squares are obscured and we don't know if something is there or not.
